/**
 * dsh-status — publishes the root agents' turn state for the native traffic light.
 *
 * One DSH process can drive several sessions at once, so a single state field
 * cannot say "one finished while another is still working". Every root session
 * keeps its own entry, the published `state` is the headline among them, and the
 * whole picture travels in `meta.sessions` so a renderer can aggregate for
 * itself.
 *
 * The renderer has to do that last step because only it knows what the user has
 * already read: an acknowledgement is a fact about the viewer, not about the
 * harness. So the publisher reports, and the renderer decides.
 *
 * Deliberate properties:
 * - **Root sessions only, for turn bookkeeping.** `agent/turn-stopping` fires for
 *   subagents too, and a child's turn end must not be read as a session's.
 * - **An ask is charged to the session that owns it.** A subagent blocked on an
 *   approval still needs the human, so it lands on its parent session rather
 *   than becoming a session of its own.
 * - **Never break a turn.** Every listener is wrapped, the writer swallows its
 *   own failures, and `agent/pre-step` always delegates to `next()`.
 * - **A turn's end comes from the agent's status, not only from an event.**
 *   `agent/turn-stopping` misses a stopped turn; `agent/status: idle` does not.
 * - **No dependencies at all** — see `config.js` for why.
 *
